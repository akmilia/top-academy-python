I was told a million times
Of all the troubles in my way
Mind you grow a little wiser
Little better every day

But if I crossed a million rivers
And I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started
Bread and butter for a smile

Well I sold a million mirrors
In a shop in Alley Way
But I never saw my face
In any window any day

Now they say your folks are telling you
"Be a superstar,"
But I tell you just be satisfied
And stay right where you are

Keep yourself alive yeah
Keep yourself alive
Take you all your time and a money
Honey you'll survive

Well I've loved a million women
In a belladonnic haze
And I ate a million dinners
Brought to me on silver trays
